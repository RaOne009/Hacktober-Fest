3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,400
Samuel.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,680
I have to ask you some questions.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,080
You haven't been at this
school for long, right?

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,600
RECONSTRUCTION OF:
SAN ESTEBAN HIGH SCHOOL

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,560
No, almost four months. I
used to attend San Esteban.

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,000
San Esteban, the school that collapsed?

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,960
Calm down. It's going to be alright.

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,840
Another woman's after your husband.

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,960
Have you noticed anything off lately?

12
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,360
What are you doing?

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,000
It's hers, I was just holding it
for her. This kid, I'm telling you.

14
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,760
To win over the locals,

15
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,280
the construction company decided
to fund three scholarships...

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,240
to study here at Las Encinas.

17
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,880
I was one of the lucky ones.

18
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,240
Samu!

19
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,640
- What's up, man?
- How are you?

20
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Hello, beautiful. Shit, sorry.
You're not gonna sacrifice yourself

21
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,880
because of what I said, right?

22
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
Do you know each other?

23
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,080
He's a buddy of my brother.

24
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,480
This is fucking paradise, man.

25
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,240
Can't you smell it? Those chicks
pee cologne, dude. I'm telling you.

26
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Let's take a walk around, okay?

27
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,160
Look at that. They stare
as if we were Martians.

28
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
You get used to it.

29
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,800
Come, a photo, right? Let's
take a selfie, or something.

30
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,480
Let's take a look around.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
You can't use your cell phone here.

32
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,440
If they catch you, they'll
take it, and keep it for a week.

33
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,120
That's against the constitution.

34
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
- You've read the constitution?
- No. I'm waiting for the movie.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,760
- It's in the handbook.
- Have you read the handbook?

36
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,960
When your name is Nadia Shana,

37
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,480
you better know what
can get you expelled.

38
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Just in case.

39
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,360
Whoo! The swimming pool
is bigger than the school!

40
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
You liked to swim, didn't you?

41
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,320
You were in the same class.

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Samuel.

43
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,920
You'd be saving us a
lot of time and work

44
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,800
if you answered a simple question.

45
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
Why did you have blood on you?

46
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,640
I've done nothing. I
want a lawyer, please.

47
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
What else is forbidden?

48
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,640
Drinking, smoking on
the grounds, doing drugs.

49
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,696
- They don't allow anything cool?
- Depends on what you think is cool.

50
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,600
- Olé.
- Hey!

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,080
Whoo-hoo!

52
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,920
- What the fuck, man?
- Sorry!

53
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Don't cry!

54
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
This is your classroom.

55
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,320
Wait for your teacher, and after
class I'll assign you lockers.

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,760
- Welcome!
- Cool.

57
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
- Are you the new students?
- Yes.

58
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Good luck, then. You're gonna need it.

59
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,160
What's up, guys! I'm Christian.

60
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Look at this one.

61
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Hi there.

62
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Hello.

63
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,920
- Not there!
- Is it taken?

64
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
- By an invisible friend.
- Oh! Enjoy his company.

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Good morning, class! How's
everybody doing today?

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Please, sit down.

67
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,200
Okay.

68
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,520
So, as we all know, we have
three new students with us today.

69
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,960
Let's meet them.

70
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,240
- Damn. Wasn't this a tutorial class?
- In English. It's a bilingual school.

71
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
You knew that, right?

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Christian Varela.

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes.

74
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
Do you want to introduce
yourself to the class?

75
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
What's he saying?

76
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,520
- Introduce yourself.
- Ah! Yes.

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,280
Um... Hello. Um...

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,920
Goodbye?

79
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,160
OK... Great.

80
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
Thank you, mister teacher.

81
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
- "Mister teacher."
- Nadia Shana.

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,320
Hello, I'm Nadia. I'm 16.

83
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,520
My family is from Palestine.
But I was born here in Spain.

84
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
And when I finish my studies,

85
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,400
I'd like to be professional
diplomat in the United Nations.

86
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Wow! Impressive.

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,080
You know, every year we
choose our best student, and...

88
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,360
the trophy is rather ugly,

89
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,698
but it allows you to study
the following year at...

90
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,160
Who can tell me where?

91
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Carla.

92
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,600
At a school in Florida.

93
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Which gives you access to
an Ivy League University.

94
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,680
- And how can you win it?
- By standing out in all activities.

95
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,760
Curricular and extracurricular. The
more extracurricular, the better.

96
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,520
Photography, chess,
Chinese, check out the list.

97
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,600
If I were you, I'd watch out for
this one. She'll give you no quarter.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ridiculous.

99
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Wasn't this a secular school?

100
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Samuel García.

101
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
Hi. My name is Samuel...

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
and I feel like anything I
say will be used against me,

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,080
- so I'll better remain quiet.
- How darling!

104
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,640
Don't be afraid. At this
school we teach values.

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,280
Manners and respect are paramount.

106
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,640
The leaders of tomorrow
are at this school.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
I know. That's what I fear.

108
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
What did the waiter say?

109
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
He's talking to us.

110
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,280
- Guys.
- Sorry.

111
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Alright. My name's Samuel, and I
am, as your classmate said, a waiter.

112
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,066
Strange as it may seem to you,

113
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,000
sometimes waiters get
a seat at the table.

114
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,680
But you don't need to worry, I'm
not here to take anybody's place.

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,440
You are still the leaders of tomorrow.

116
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

117
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,120
So, why don't we continue with
where we left it yesterday?

118
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,960
Of all the people there, you
had to mess with my brother.

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,160
That was your brother?

120
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,200
And people say we, rich
people, don't suffer.

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
I see.

122
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Shall we?

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
Hey... in case nobody's told you,
it's cool having you in class.

125
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Thanks.

126
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Hello.

127
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Where are you going?
We'll walk with you.

128
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,056
- Stop being such an asshole.
- Watch that mouth.

129
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,040
We're only trying to be friendly.
What's the matter, waiter?

130
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,760
Do you like my sister?

131
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,680
- She's a fan of lost causes...
- Guzmán, go to hell.

132
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Seriously, leave him alone.

133
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,360
Let us have him for a while.
We want to get to know him.

134
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,320
Or are you afraid of us?

135
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
- He is afraid of us!
- He is, yeah.

136
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,520
Waiter... don't lay a hand on my sister.

137
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,320
Imagine you have a restraining order.

138
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,280
Guzmán... take this.

139
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Nadia.

140
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Can you come with me for a
moment? The principal wants a word.

141
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,960
No one had mentioned the scarf.

142
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Why now?

143
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,400
Per our rules, no supplementary
vestures are allowed.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,777
My hijab is not supplementary.

145
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:04,360
Besides, everybody
has things around here.

146
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Expensive bags, gold watches.

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
Those are ornamental,
they don't mean anything.

148
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
They do. They mean many things.

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,440
They mean "I have more money than you,

150
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,880
more style than you.
I'm better than you."

151
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,760
- Nadia, we understand you, really, but...
- Look, if you understood...

152
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,680
you wouldn't ask me to give
up my culture or my religion.

153
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Nadia, think about it.

154
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
It's up to you.

155
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,080
But if you wear it tomorrow...

156
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,720
we'll have no option but to expel you.

157
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,040
Who do you think calls the shots here?

158
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,640
Shouldn't you be worrying
about other things now?

159
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,520
About the fact that you speak
no English, for instance.

160
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,800
Come on, it's not "nothing",
it's "a little but."

161
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,120
I got it all under control. You
lend me your notes "in English"...

162
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,520
and I translate them online
to know what it's all about.

163
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm not going to give you my
notes. And you shouldn't be here.

164
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,080
You're taking a spot
somebody else actually needs.

165
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,240
Wait, do you think I
am here to study? No.

166
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm here to meet the
people who rule the roost.

167
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,180
They are not those with the best grades,

168
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,440
but those who make the best friends.

169
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Watch.

170
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,776
- What time's the party?
- What party?

171
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,520
Anybody say party? Hi, I'm Christian.

172
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,800
Yes. Hello! Do you speak Spanish?

173
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,160
I was talking to my friends.

174
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Oh, sorry. By the way,
are you on Instagram?

175
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
I can give you mine, if you want.

176
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,200
Yes, please!

177
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
It's "pekechristian007,"
the first one is a "K."

178
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,640
Pekechristian.

179
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Pekechristian. Oh, no!

180
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,840
I've fucking had it with these people.

181
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,560
I don't understand how they
got into this school. I don't.

182
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,840
Wow, this video! Look at this.

183
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,920
Do not touch me!

184
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,320
Lu, don't be mean.

185
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,680
- Pay no attention to my friend.
- So, what about this party?

186
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,480
My sister's coming out party is
private, like our conversation.

187
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
Who do I need to talk to
about getting an invite?

188
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,560
You've never partied with me. You
had a roof collapse on you, right?

189
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,320
Maybe the blow impaired
your ability to take a hint.

190
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,360
Shall I say it in
English, so you get it?

191
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Goodbye.

192
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
- And if I don't feel like it?
- Look...

193
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,520
As you're slow-witted, you
don't get how things work here.

194
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,880
But your friend there
is starting to get it.

195
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,520
Come, let's go, Guzmán.

196
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,040
Cool video.

197
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,560
Christian, it can happen
to anyone, going too far.

198
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
It's the end of the school year party...

199
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
There's alcohol.

200
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,480
I don't know, maybe a
fight gets out of control.

201
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,840
What do I have to do with it?

202
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm not like that.

203
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,480
Can you interrogate me if
my parents are not present?

204
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,200
These are just questions.

205
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
But if you don't want to cooperate,
we can take you to the station.

206
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,240
With your parents, and a lawyer.

207
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,560
How did you get that injury?

208
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
I hit myself on a door.

209
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,360
Why do I get the feeling
you are lying to me?

210
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,320
The change may end up
not being all that bad.

211
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,240
How is your new school?

212
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,440
Imagine, I'm a Muslim,
I don't play soccer,

213
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
and I was caught reading
a book in the hallway.

214
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
There'll be wanted signs
with my face tomorrow.

215
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,360
The reward will be a reggaeton concert.

216
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,080
I'm a dead man, then.

217
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,889
Shit, man, I wish some
rubble had fallen on me

218
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,120
when the school collapsed.

219
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Christian got 14 stitches.

220
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Yeah, and a scholarship
to Las Encinas, dickhead.

221
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,736
With any luck, the same will
happen to you at your new school.

222
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,920
- No such luck, I'm afraid.
- Roofs do collapse.

223
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
You're the worst!

224
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Hi.

225
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
Look at him.

226
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
He looks like a minister.

227
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Little brother!

228
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
Little brother!

229
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,920
Goodness me!

230
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,720
- Doing well in fancy-land?
- Yes.

231
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm ready to fight
anybody who bothers you.

232
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
What are you doing here?

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,616
- What, you're not happy to see me?
- Yes! But have they let you out?

234
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,280
No, I'm still there. What do you
think? Come, let's have a beer.

235
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Here you go.

236
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,840
Wow! This is nice, right?

237
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,880
The three of us together again.

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
- The family goes out tonight.
- I can't tonight.

239
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,520
- You can.
- I work tonight, Nano.

240
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,080
Call in sick, and that's it.

241
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,375
What if they find out I'm lying?

242
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,200
It's the only job we
have since you left.

243
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,880
Is this how it's gonna be?

244
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,680
Samu, I didn't leave.
They made me leave.

245
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,880
- How was your first day?
- Very good.

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
OPEN

247
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
CLOSED

248
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,720
How about this one?

249
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Do you like it?

250
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Mom...

251
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,000
You showed me that one yesterday.
The answer remains the same.

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,600
You don't like anything, Marina.

253
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,600
Is it that hard to be
a bit more enthusiastic?

254
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,720
Mom and Dad are doing
all of this for you.

255
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
For me?

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,360
- But nobody's asked them.
- Sweetheart...

257
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,825
We want to celebrate
that you are a woman,

258
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,560
and you're coming out into society.

259
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,560
Presenting me as a virginal young
lady looking for a boyfriend.

260
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Marina, please.

261
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
What?

262
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,360
Are we never going to talk about it?

263
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,760
How about the new students?

264
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,640
A moron, a fundamentalist,
and one with raised fist.

265
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,520
- As a joke, they'd be priceless.
- Hey...

266
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,680
Why don't you ask one
of them to the party?

267
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Are you serious?

268
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Why not?

269
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,400
Have you lost your mind?

270
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,720
Hello. No, I told you
not to worry. Okay?

271
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
I think it's a great idea.

272
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
Besides, it's my party, right?

273
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,440
Son of a bitch!

274
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
Cool.

275
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,600
Hey! Have you seen my
uniform? No? Nothing?

276
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,720
You haven't seen my clothes?

277
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
What's up, handsome?

278
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,960
Hello, beautiful. You haven't
seen my clothes, really?

279
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,600
No? Come on! There we are!

280
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Alright, then. Fuck you all.

281
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,840
Enjoy the view! This too, come on.
Wouldn't you like to have this ass.

282
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,760
Hey, would you like to come to a
party at my place tomorrow evening?

283
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
Why would you invite me to a party?

284
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,160
Because I need somebody else
to enjoy it as little as me.

285
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
Besides, wouldn't you like
to see my brother's face?

286
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,920
Okay.

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Your hair looks nice today.

288
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,000
Did you have any problems
with the other students?

289
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,960
No. Not with anybody.

290
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,160
How was your relationship with
the students at the school?

291
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,880
Did you get along? Were you friends?

292
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,840
You're Ander, right?

293
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,160
I've seen all your trophies,
man. I'm crazy about tennis.

294
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,560
Come on, guys! To your next class!

295
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:02,360
Anybody left in the locker room?

296
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,480
What are you doing?

297
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
- Anything wrong?
- No, why?

298
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
OK, then. Off to class.

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,480
Thanks a lot, man. You're alright.

300
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
No, I'm not. I just saved your ass.

301
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
You could pay me back.

302
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,880
Guzmán!

303
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,416
- What?
- We've been seen, damn it!

304
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
- What is it?
- Shit!

305
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,400
- We've been seen.
- Shit!

306
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,850
Don't worry, he'll be here.

307
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,480
I talked to him ten minutes ago.

308
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,880
Besides, nobody will see
you here, man. Don't worry.

309
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,920
- But can he be trusted, or not?
- Of course!

310
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,760
What's he gonna do? Go on TV to
say a rich boy is buying joints?

311
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Come on! That wouldn't be news.

312
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,160
I just don't want
them to know at school.

313
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,696
Who's going to find out? I won't
tell anyone, don't worry, man.

314
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,960
Besides, I don't even have
any friends in there. Or do I?

315
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,520
Yeah! Good man!

316
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
By the way, man, I wanted
to ask you something.

317
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,360
- Shoot.
- Why do you all mess with us so much?

318
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Something happened with
a scholarship student.

319
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,840
The son of one of the cooks.

320
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,280
And they halted
scholarships for a full year.

321
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,080
It was a huge mess.

322
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,880
Until you arrived.

323
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
Hey!

324
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,040
What's up, man?

325
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
- How are you?
- Hi.

326
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,120
I'll introduce you, Mr. X, Mr.
Dealer. Sorry, no real names.

327
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,280
Thank you, much obliged.

328
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,520
Have you seen how well-mannered?

329
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,120
You can't complain, I
bring you quality clients.

330
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't you forget.

331
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,400
By the way, you and I
will talk. You owe me one!

332
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,000
Here we go, now we are all set.

333
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,680
- Hey, my man!
- So good to see you!

334
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,040
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

335
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,280
Hang in there! Fifteen,
sixteen, that's it!

336
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,720
So, they make a school
collapse, and get away with it.

337
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Can't wrap my fucking head around that!

338
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,720
- When will the others be released?
- What do I know, man?

339
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
That's how the world works.

340
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,170
Some of us in jail for some small shit,

341
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,240
and the real crooks out on the street.

342
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,520
It figures.

343
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
I almost didn't live to tell
it. I got a huge cut in my head.

344
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,240
But, that got me a
ticket to fancy-land.

345
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,320
It's no joke, Christian, what
if there had been casualties?

346
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,000
This is not okay. This
country is a fucking joke.

347
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,680
Let's give your brother
a drink, we're losing him!

348
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
- There are none left.
- None?

349
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
I can solve that in a
second. Be right back.

350
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,640
Man, save, and you can buy it.

351
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,360
A little stuck on that topic, isn't he?

352
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,760
I mean, I don't know, Nano is
like a brother to me, you know.

353
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,360
And... my brother's brother
is also my brother, right?

354
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
You want my notes from class?

355
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
WELCOME. SHALL WE CREATE YOUR PROFILE?

356
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
A GUY

357
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,280
Look at him! Like a baby.

358
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,440
Catch!

359
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,280
I have a romantic idea worthy of
a movie. Jaime, I'm borrowing it.

360
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,160
Nano, can you tell me where we're going?

361
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,800
To visit our friend the
constructor, so he remembers us.

362
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,300
- Get off. Get off!
- What?

363
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Keep watch.

364
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,160
No! What are you doing?
Don't even think about it!

365
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Yes! Let's enjoy it, Samu.

366
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Nano!

367
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
You just got out of jail, and this
is the dumbest shit you could do!

368
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,440
Nano, someone's coming! Nano!

369
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,896
- What?
- Someone's coming, let's go!

370
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Motherfucker...

371
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,760
THI

372
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Come on!

373
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,160
Just one more thing, Nadia.
Help us, and then you can go.

374
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
What can you tell me about this trophy?

375
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Why?

376
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
We think it's the murder weapon.

377
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
What?

378
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,840
We've been told you wanted
to win it more than anything.

379
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Just me?

380
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,800
It's her word against ours.

381
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
You want to risk them believing her?

382
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
- This is all your fault.
- Mine?

383
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,560
Yes, you and your silly obsession
with doing it in public places.

384
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Sure.

385
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,840
As if you didn't like it.

386
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Hello.

387
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Sorry about yesterday.
We thought we were alone.

388
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
I wish.

389
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Look, I know we started off on the
wrong foot. I'd like to fix that.

390
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,120
Why don't you come tonight to
my sister's coming out party?

391
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,480
We can get to know each other.

392
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,360
Thanks, but no.

393
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
Have a nice day.

394
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Boo!

395
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
I love her!

396
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,840
Who? Carla? Her mother
is a Spanish grandee.

397
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Do you know the Marquesado
de Caleruega wines?

398
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,320
- No.
- That's her mommy, the marchioness.

399
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,040
Well, and that guy, Polo, is her
boyfriend, since they were 12.

400
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,680
That one? For real?

401
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,960
No, come on, she deserves much
better. You're fucking kidding me!

402
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
If I were you, I'd watch
out for the girls here.

403
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah. I'll be watching this one.

404
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Nadia.

405
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
How are you?

406
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,280
Listen, I'd like you
to come to my party.

407
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,640
Thank you, but it isn't my scene.

408
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,120
You can come in your scarf, or
without it. Come as you want, okay?

409
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
It's called a hijab.

410
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Not a scarf.

411
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Hijab.

412
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,280
- And nobody forces me to wear it.
- Lucky you!

413
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,160
I do feel like I'm being forced to
have this ridiculous coming out party.

414
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,600
I don't know. Give us a chance.
We're not all like my brother.

415
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
It starts at eight.

416
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,040
Samuel has the address.

417
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,200
- Fuck, man, this doesn't pull well.
- Don't laugh at the newbie, okay?

418
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,760
I'm not laughing, for a first joint,

419
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,800
made with a tutorial, it's not bad.

420
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,200
By the way, why the fuck don't
you wanna go to the party?

421
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,640
Still obsessing about the
party, give me a break!

422
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,895
I'm not obsessing,

423
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:31,920
you may be used to all of
this stuff and this luxury,

424
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,640
but I'm not, this is all new
to me. I'm excited about it.

425
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,480
What do you think? That I
live like the rest of them?

426
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,800
- You don't?
- Not even close.

427
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,080
Then what the fuck are
you doing at that school?

428
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
Kid, I'm the principal's son.

429
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,600
Son of a bitch! You
are fucking plugged in!

430
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Anyway...

431
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
- You want to go, right?
- Of course.

432
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
- Are you positive?
- Completely, yes.

433
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,000
- Do you have anything decent to wear?
- Of course I do, man!

434
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,480
- What are you doing here?
- Nadia wants to go to the party.

435
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,360
And my father says if there's no
alcohol, and there's parents there...

436
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,360
- Say yes, I want to go home.
- Yeah, man, don't worry.

437
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Shit.

438
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,480
This is a serious party.

439
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
THI

440
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,080
What's up, Samu?

441
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,480
- Hi.
- You didn't expect to see me here, huh?

442
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,600
Let's go in!

443
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Here you have it, a coming out
party in all its ridiculousness!

444
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,920
What is it for? In other times,
to find a husband quickly.

445
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,200
Nowadays it's more
to widen your network.

446
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Although the husband
thing is not ruled out.

447
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,480
You're so much fun when you drink.

448
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,640
Wow, you rich people
know how to throw a party!

449
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Are you color blind?

450
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,400
Or did you not turn on the
light when you got dressed?

451
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,360
Lu, don't be mean. Handsome guys
look good whatever they wear.

452
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,800
We've already said hi. Are you staying?

453
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,600
I don't know. Do you want me to stay?

454
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,600
- If you say yes, I'll stay forever.
- Well, well, let's start with a drink.

455
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,920
Please.

456
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Ah, move aside.

457
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,360
Can you explain to me why
you've brought the influencer?

458
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,040
- You've brought the girl, right?
- It's my home, Ander.

459
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,127
I don't know, because
he really wanted to come.

460
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:18,520
Nothing's going to happen.

461
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
This whole crusade of yours
against them is ridiculous.

462
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Look...

463
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,680
I forgive you, because
you're really drunk.

464
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,920
But I wouldn't have betrayed
you like that. Never!

465
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,480
What betrayal, Guzmán?

466
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
What betrayal?

467
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,080
Fucking champagne! Where's the beer?

468
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
You've come.

469
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
Dad.

470
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,800
Pleased to meet you.

471
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,589
The balls on you, kid, showing up here!

472
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,080
Don't you know we have security cameras?

473
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
Shall we talk later?

474
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,680
Only alcohol can make
this tolerable. Here.

475
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Thanks. I don't drink.

476
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,160
It's going to be a hard night, then.

477
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,520
- I'm leaving soon.
- Of course.

478
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,445
Why give us a chance

479
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:27,760
when you have already sentenced
and judged us all, right?

480
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,920
Here's everything you
hate about the West.

481
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,040
All the sinful decadence.

482
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,520
I thought I was the one judging.

483
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,440
But I can see you have decided
what I think and what I don't.

484
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,120
With a scarf on your head, you
can't possibly think much, dear.

485
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Is this about me not
accepting the champagne?

486
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,280
Or your congenital racism?

487
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,720
Forgive me. Oh, no, forgive me.
Sorry, I came here in peace, I swear.

488
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,320
I'm sure you and I have
something in common.

489
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,280
Don't worry. I've come
to Las Encinas to study.

490
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm not interested in
anything beyond that.

491
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,920
Let me give you some advice, dear.

492
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
You can do it all.

493
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,640
Look at me.

494
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,440
I date, I have fun, a lot.

495
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,480
And I'm top of the class.

496
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,720
Or you were. Right?

497
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,760
So? What do you think of my party?

498
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,240
Wouldn't you love to set us all on fire?

499
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,600
OK. I'll order a glass
of water, just in case.

500
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,360
Samuel...

501
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,920
Sorry I didn't tell you my
father's construction company...

502
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,080
- was the one from your school.
- Right. It would have been good to know.

503
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm not like him.

504
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,880
And to be honest, I think
I don't even like him.

505
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,640
But he's done all of this for you.

506
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Yeah, he's very good at solving
problems throwing money at them.

507
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Wanna dance?

508
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,960
- What?
- Why are you like this, Lu?

509
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,920
Don't you see? It's not
about the skirt, I don't care.

510
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,400
It's about that Taliban
girl. That little hypocrite.

511
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,680
Wearing a scarf on your head
makes you superior to us?

512
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
- Please, how ridiculous!
- I don't want her here either.

513
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,960
But we have to do something,
so she won't tell on us.

514
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
I have an idea.

515
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Let's hear it.

516
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,080
I propose a game. Why
don't you seduce her?

517
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,760
Then everybody finds
out... and that's that.

518
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
You want me to hook up
with the Palestinian girl,

519
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,040
who walks around school in a turban?

520
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,200
Oh, sweetie...

521
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,866
the idea of making a
virginal Muslim girl

522
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:15,920
fall for you doesn't turn you on?

523
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,360
Come on, you woo her, she falls
for you, everybody finds out...

524
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,000
That's it! We cut her down to size,
she can't act all superior anymore.

525
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,360
Not even if I ask you?

526
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,760
Then I'll let you do
whatever you want with me.

527
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,400
But I already do
whatever I want with you.

528
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,680
Not even half of it.

529
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,400
I'm thinking, today would be
a good day to do it. Right?

530
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,800
I call the tow truck, and
they don't come for me.

531
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Well, I don't know.

532
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,400
Here? Right now?

533
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
And why not?

534
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,800
But if you're not sure,
let's forget about it.

535
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Hey.

536
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,640
- Samuel, right?
- Yes.

537
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
What exactly did you mean to
write here, on my front wall?

538
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,320
T-H-I...

539
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
"S."

540
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
"This above all: to
thine own self be true."

541
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
- Ah.
- It's a quote from Hamlet.

542
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,160
Yes, of course, a quote
from Hamlet. Ingenious.

543
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
But...

544
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,520
I think you wanted to write...

545
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,633
Thief, son of a bitch,

546
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,960
or one of those names the
press is calling me lately.

547
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,621
Bring the other two scholarship kids,

548
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:48,640
and we'll take a photo
of the four of us.

549
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,480
Shaking hands and smiling.

550
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
I don't know.

551
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Come, man.

552
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,800
What's wrong with taking a photo?
It could be good for everybody.

553
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,680
For the town, for the
school, even for you.

554
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,040
I wouldn't feel comfortable
doing it, to be honest.

555
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,290
It's OK, kid. I'll report your
brother to the police tomorrow,

556
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:09,360
see what happens to his parole.

557
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Think about it.

558
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
What did he say?

559
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,400
He wants a picture with
the scholarship students.

560
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,840
- Really?
- Yes.

561
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,600
That's why he wanted me to invite
you. His image makeover bullshit.

562
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,840
He doesn't waste an opportunity.

563
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,760
Samuel, don't play
along. You don't have to.

564
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,200
I don't mind doing it.

565
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
What's wrong?

566
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
Nothing.

567
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,760
I don't know. I thought
you were different.

568
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,760
Hello.

569
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,520
Can you come and get me?

570
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,560
Come on, ... we have things to do.

571
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,000
What is this?

572
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,880
Olé.

573
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,760
We have 15 minutes before
they realize I'm not there.

574
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,280
Are you taking your clothes off?

575
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
That comes off, too.

576
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,600
But slowly, so I can see you.

577
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,360
Okay. You too. Let's
do it at the same time.

578
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
Like this?

579
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,080
Am I doing it right?

580
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,840
Yes, you're doing fucking great.

581
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,080
Hey, cool profile

582
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Yours too. What's up?

583
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,920
Bored. Shall we meet?

584
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,920
Do you have another photo?

585
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,240
I can't believe it.
Explain it to me, please.

586
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,960
You knew it was him who ruined our wall,

587
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,960
and you let him in our home?

588
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,160
- Who?
- The thin one.

589
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,080
But only because he had ulterior
motives, he wanted a picture with him.

590
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
What?

591
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,840
Mom, I don't know why you are surprised.

592
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,880
You are the only one dad
still manages to disappoint.

593
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,400
Those people are poison,
Marina, and you know it.

594
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,480
Why are you with them every
time I turn around, Marina? Why?

595
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,840
Why don't you leave them alone?

596
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,240
Because I refuse to let
you get hurt again, Marina!

597
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,720
- Pablo did not mean to hurt me!
- Marina!

598
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
It's not the moment. Please.

599
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Then when?

600
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,000
Tell me when is the moment. Why
can't we talk about what happened?

601
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,330
You've spent a fortune on psychologists

602
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:54,040
to convince me nothing happened.

603
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,080
That life goes on. That
everything would be alright.

604
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
And you know what?

605
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,040
Every time you avoid the subject,
I feel like a piece of shit.

606
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
I fell in love with
a boy. He infected me.

607
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,440
I need you to say it!

608
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,600
Say it! Say it, Mom!

609
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,680
"My 16-year-old daughter
is HIV-positive."

610
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,160
Do you regret tonight?

611
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,800
It was... intense.

612
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
But it was good.

613
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Sure?

614
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
Good night.

615
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,240
Good night, gorgeous.

616
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,760
I love you. I love you more than ever.

617
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,640
You! You get a scholarship,
and you thank us like this?

618
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,120
- Guzmán!
- Vandalizing the property of others?

619
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,400
- You disgust me!
- What's going on here?

620
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,680
And who are you? Unbelievable,
the riffraff we get here tonight!

621
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
Shall I take that as a
compliment or punch you?

622
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,040
Take it as you will.

623
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,360
- Let's go.
- I won't let this prep boy insult us.

624
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm not insulting you,
just stating the facts.

625
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,760
One question.

626
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,880
What do you call people who keep
millions that don't belong to them,

627
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,880
so they can live the way you do?

628
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,400
Thieves, or simply bastards?

629
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,520
You dare come to this house
to insult me and my family.

630
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,640
Who do you think you are, fucking clown?

631
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,200
- What are you doing?
- Okay.

632
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,680
You don't deserve my brother!

633
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,920
Get off me!

634
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,440
Shove your money up your asses!

635
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,400
You! Hey! You are finished!

636
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,080
Tomorrow, everybody at school will
know you are a fucking criminal!

637
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,880
And forget about your scholarship.

638
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Guzmán, please. Are you
okay? Did they hurt you?

639
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,680
Does it hurt a lot?

640
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Polo...

641
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,680
Why don't you go for a walk and
stop making a fool of yourself?

642
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,120
Go!

643
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
Guzmán,

644
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
don't take it out on
Samuel, he's a good person.

645
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Let's see what the
principal says tomorrow.

646
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,800
Your sister is right.
Samuel is a good person.

647
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Me, not so much.

648
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,015
If you say anything at school,

649
00:46:58,016 --> 00:46:59,960
you'll force me to tell
what I saw in the shower.

650
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,200
Thanks for inviting me.

651
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,680
Nadia.

652
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,160
Nadia, you win.

653
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,200
I spoke in the heat of the moment.
I won't tell on your friend.

654
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,080
Stay a little longer.

655
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,560
Let me show you we
are worth the trouble.

656
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,560
You are too good looking
over your shoulder.

657
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,720
Teach me how to look at you. I
promise I'll be a fast learner.

658
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,400
What's going on, honey?

659
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,080
This one needs to be
taken down a peg or two.

660
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,880
Hey.

661
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,760
Do you plan to remain mute all night?

662
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,600
Had I known, I wouldn't
have stood up for you.

663
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,176
You are clueless, aren't you? Do
you know what I've done for you?

664
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
I had it under control, and
you had to come and screw it up.

665
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,080
And now I must clean up after you!

666
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,480
I was protecting you, asshole! It's
what I've been doing my whole life.

667
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,640
I never asked you for that!

668
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,590
Come on, Samu! I won't let those people,

669
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:46,720
who are a real cancer, laugh at you!

670
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,360
Your whole life you've been blaming
them, maybe you are the cancer.

671
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,560
Is Samuel home?

672
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,440
- Is Samuel here?
- He's sleeping.

673
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,400
He was up all night hugging the toilet.

674
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
Says it's hangover.

675
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,200
I think it's the panic of having
to go back to that fucking school.

676
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,040
He can come back, no problem.

677
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,680
That's what I came to tell him.
My brother won't say anything.

678
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
Very well.

679
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,120
Was there anything else?

680
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,920
Coffee, water, beer?

681
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,800
Sit down, if you want.

682
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,560
Did you tag my wall?

683
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,280
My letter of introduction.

684
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,560
Next time, finish it.

685
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,480
I liked what you said at the party.

686
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,920
You dared to shout what many
of us think. Or at least I do.

687
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,040
Somebody had to say it.

688
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
And, is it true you've been in jail?

689
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,560
You love to ask questions, huh?

690
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,880
Yes, but for a short spell.

691
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,760
Sleeping rough, eating worse.

692
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,680
No women, unless you count
my mother or my lawyer.

693
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,480
A second aunt from Murcia,

694
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:19,320
I'm not sure why she came
all the way up to see me...

695
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,240
None like you, I can tell you that.

696
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,360
Stay another minute,
and I'll make you iron.

697
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,680
I'm leaving.

698
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
Better.

699
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

700
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,440
Here you go. Washed and
pressed. By the way...

701
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,200
Fancy girl was here. She
wants you to go back to school.
